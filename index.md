## [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/Chros08/Freecodecamp_projects/blob/main/Freecodecamp/freecodecamp_p1/freecodecamp_p1.ipynb)
* Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## [ Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Chros08/Freecodecamp_projects/blob/main/Freecodecamp/freecodecamp_p2/freecodecamp_p2.ipynb)
* Analyze demographic data using Pandas.Given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/Chros08/Freecodecamp_projects/blob/main/Freecodecamp/freecodecamp_p3/Untitled.ipynb)
* Use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

## [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/Chros08/Freecodecamp_projects/blob/main/Freecodecamp/freecodecamp_p4/freecodecamp_test.4.ipynb)
* Visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/Chros08/Freecodecamp_projects/blob/main/Freecodecamp/freecodecamp_p4/freecodecamp_test.5.ipynb)
* Analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
